                                    CoRE Lore is an annual event that occurs around Thanksgiving. Every year current CoRE members invite all of their alumni back to campus for a Thanksgiving-esque feast. The main part of CoRE Lore, besides eating of course, are the stories that the alumni
                                    tell. Anybody that has a funny story or something funny to talk about from their time on CoRE, can get up and tell everybody. We eat, we laugh, and we have a great time.
